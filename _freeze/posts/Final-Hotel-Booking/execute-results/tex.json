The dataset spans check-in dates from July 2015 to August 2017, providing a comprehensive view of booking trends and guest preferences during this period. The primary research questions addressed include identifying the optimal time of year for booking hotels in Portugal, the most common distribution channels for bookings, peak months for hotel occupancy, the top countries of origin for guests, and potential factors contributing to high cancellation rates.\n\n## Importing Packages\nI utilized various R packages such as tidyverse, ggplot2, and readr to import, clean, and visualize the data. \n\n\n\n\n## Loading in the Data set\nThe dataset was loaded into R as a tibble for efficient data manipulation and analysis.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhoteldata <- read.csv(\"_data/hotel_bookings.csv\", stringsAsFactors=TRUE)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhoteldata <-

My exploration aimed to understand the origins of the majority of customers, the prevalent hotel types, the peak booking year, the market segment with the shortest waiting list days, and the busiest months for both city hotels and resorts. One intriguing discovery was the consistent demand for resort hotels throughout the year compared to the fluctuating trend observed in city hotels, contrary to initial expectations.\n\nWhile this analysis provided valuable insights, there are notable limitations in the dataset. One limitation is the absence of information regarding potential accommodation upgrades or amenities associated with encoded room types. This missing data hinders a comprehensive understanding of customer preferences and their impact on booking behavior. Additionally, the inability to discern specific room features limits the depth of analysis regarding factors influencing guest satisfaction and potential booking cancellations.\n\nMoving forward, refining these insights by incorporating data on accommodation upgrades, amenities, and guest preferences could enhance the predictive accuracy of models and provide more nuanced recommendations for hotel management. Understanding the factors influencing guest satisfaction and booking decisions is crucial in optimizing hotel operations and delivering exceptional guest experiences.\n\nOverall, this analysis underscores the complexity of the hotel booking industry and the importance of leveraging comprehensive data to drive informed decision-making and enhance customer experiences.\n\n# Bibliography\n\n<https://ggplot2-book.org/>\n\n<https://github.com/hadley/tidyr>\n\n<https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340918315191>\n\n<https://www.researchgate.net/publication/329286343_Hotel_booking_demand_datasets>\n",
